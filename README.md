# Lax Dashboard

Lax Dashboard is a project that I am currently still developing. It is a dashboard project that I created using React, Material UI, and Firebase. The app requires authentication to use and it allows teams to be able to track certain metrics among their team. Admins have access to views everyones dashboard, a team page to quickly see player info, and a table that allows them to update data to Firebase. Players are able to view their dashboard and a profile page that shows their individual scores in each category.

**College/Club Teams:** Admins will be manually added and then given a team code that will allow their players to sign up through the sign up feature.

High school sign up is a new feature that was implemented. This allows high school students to sign up for an account. Upon sign up, high school users will be able to go to their profile page where there are inputs for links to videos of their various tests. These inputs allow players to submit a new link every 90 days. The input will update upon submission and will display a countdown showing how much time is remaining. The countdown is in days until there is under a day left, in which the format changes to hours and minutes remaining. Upon validation, a high school admin will input their scores. This allows high school students to see how they match up with kids across the country.
