# Lax Dashboard

### Still currently working on!

This is a dashboard project created using React, Firebase, and Material UI. Requires authentication to use, and it allows teams to be able to track certain metrics among their team. Admins have access to view everyones dashboard, a team page to quickly see player info, and a table that allows them to update data to Firebase. Players are able to view their dashboard and a profile page that shows their individual scores in each category.
